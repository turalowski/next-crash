1. You can check `app/about/page.tsx` to see how to add metadata and render static page.
2. You don't need to add api routes to `app/api` but it's good convention to follow.
3. You can create an async component to fetch data in the component's itself. Check `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` 
4. We can change caching in file level or fetch call level. Check `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`
